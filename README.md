## Some insights about Airbnb apartments in Seville, Spain

The purpose of this notebook is to analyse airbnb data of the city of Seville, Spain. Throughout the notebook I'm going to answer three questions:

1. What are the neighbourhoods with more Airbnb apartments?
2. Which are the neighbourhoods with the mean apartment price more expensive?
3. How many Airbnb apartments are there inside the area (1000m) around principal monuments?

#### Libraries used:

For Data analysis: pandas, numpy 
For plots: seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot 
For Geo analysis: shapely.geometry, pyproj

#### Motivation:

The motivation is to extract some insights for more understanding of how airbnb is changing the hospitality business and its social and real estate implications in one of the most tourist cities in Spain and ,in consequence,  of the world

1. 'AirBnb in Seville.ipynb'    Jupyter notebook with all the analysis, code, tables and plots
